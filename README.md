## Testing

### Continuous testing

## Github Actions

Github built-in CI/CD is free for public repositories since Aug, 2019. It has many workflow templates, including one for Python applications. To add it and start running linting and tests on Github, click on Actions -> New Workflow -> Python Applications. This will create a new configuration `yaml` under `.github/workflows`, that by defaults execute the actions at every push on `main` branch 

## TIL
